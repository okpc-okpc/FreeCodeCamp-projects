#FreeCodeCamp Project

##Portfolio

My first Web page ever. So it's pretty ugly.

###Requirements
- User should be able to access all of the portfolio webpage's content just by scrolling
- Different buttons that will take user to the portfolio creator's different social media pages
- Thumbnail images of different projects the portfolio creator has built (or just placeholders)
- User should be able to navigate to different sections of the webpage by clicking buttons in the navigation
